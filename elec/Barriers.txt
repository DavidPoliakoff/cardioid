Issues with fast barriers:

1.  We really should do something with the calling sequence to make
these calls less cumbersome.

2.  What is the real cost of __lwsync?

3.  We need to get the initialization of offsets in the reaction code
into the right shape.  In particular the assumption that all squads are
the same size is wrong.

4.  How can we have an interface to the barriers that doesn't require
#ifdefs in the simulationLoop.
