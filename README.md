# Fiber generation for heart mesh.

The code depends on MFEM library (mfem.org). It uses algorithm from following paper:

Bayer, J. D.; Blake, R. C.; Plank, G.; Trayanova, N. A., A Novel Rule-Based Algorithm for Assigning Myocardial Fiber Orientation to Computational Heart Models. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2012, 40, 2243-2254.

Installation Guide

1. Download and install mfem library.

2. Unzip Fiber code to the mfem home directory. Compile the code by use make.
