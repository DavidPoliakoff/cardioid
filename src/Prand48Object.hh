/** Random number generator that combines a particle gid, a seed, and a
 *  call site id to generate a random number.  Since the underlying
 *  random engine is erand48, only the 48 low order bits in the three
 *  parameters are used.
 *
 *  The rationale for generating random numbers this way is that for a
 *  fixed user specified seed, we want reproducible results, regardless
 *  of the number of tasks the code is running on.  Since we generate a
 *  new seed for erand based on the user seed and the particle gid, we
 *  get the same number (for a given seed) regardless of the calling
 *  history of erand.  The callSite parameter allows for different call
 *  sites in the code to get different pseudo-random streams even for
 *  the same particle and user seed.
 *
 *  Issues: Even when we discard a fairly large number of initial random
 *  numbers there tends to be correlations between the random numbers
 *  for nearly equal gids.  If the gids are somehow correlated and good
 *  random numbers are important for your application, you will likely
 *  want to chose a different method, or increase the discard size.
