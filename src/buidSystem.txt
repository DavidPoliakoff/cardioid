1.  executable in bin directory
2.  short arch names
3.  opt, debug, profile
4.  with gsl
5.  standardized -D things
6.  .mk files in arch directory
7.  Don't try to guess build host.



Every .mk file must define:

CXX
CC
LD

CFLAGS - includes all switches passed to compiler including -D's


Platform specific macros:

OSX
BGL
BGP
BGQ

Questions:

1.  Why _LARGEFILE_SOURCE
2.  Why _FILE_OFFSET_BITS
3.  why -DADD_
4.  What about LDFLAGS?  Do I need to capture the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS?
