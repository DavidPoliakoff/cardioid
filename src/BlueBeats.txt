Each task has a tissue block.

The size of that tissue block is determined when the ORB file is read
and stored in globalTissueBlock.  It appears that this size accounts
only for the local elements.  

The xMaxLocal and xMaxOff (and friends) are set up later to include
extra room for the ghost cells.
