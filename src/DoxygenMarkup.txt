Cardiod Documentation Conventions, Instructions, and Style Guide.

This is presently *very* incomplete.  I'll be filling in more details as
we work on the docs.  For now, if you have specific questions, do your
best to muddle through and drop me an email so that I can work out an
answer.



* The root of the html documentation tree is in mainpage.dox (this name
  is requied by doxygen).  

* Doxygen expects text to be in C or C++ comments.  So, each .dox file
  starts with /*! (a C-style comment recognized by doxygen as the start
  of a documentation comment) and ends with */.  That is, the entire
  contents of the file is in one big C-style comment.

* Place documentation for material other than objects and keywords in
  files named <name>.dox where <name> is the page name.

* Documentation of objects and keywords should all be located in a tree
  underneath the Input File Reference page (inputFileReference.doc)

* Documentation of keywords goes in a block right above the function
  that calls objectGet.  Look at sensorFactory.cc for an example of how
  to handle objects that support polymorphic methods.

* Use the @ form of doxygen markup tags, not the \ form.

* Page labels are pg_label_name.  Note use of undescrores between
  multiple words.





Custom doxygen markup for Cardioid (implemented using the ALIAS
facility)

* @beginkeywords, @endkeywords, @kw.  Note that @kw takes three
  arguments, and that arguments are comma separted.  If an argument
  contains a comma it must be escaped (\,)
* @issue
* @path


ToDo:

* Create a proper definition of the @issue macro
* Figure out how to do examples (right now they are latex verbatim)
* Find a way to control column width in latex tables.
* Move all of the text from ANATOMY documentation into the source code.
* Need a heading alias for examples.
* What are the conventions for section headings at the top of a page?
