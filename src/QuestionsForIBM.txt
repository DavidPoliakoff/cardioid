1.  What is the valid range for theta and phi?  From the code it appears
    to be [0, 254], However, the units are apparently not degrees.
    Rather, in CalcConductivityMatrixIBT the angles are multiplied by
    PI/256.  This seems wrong for two reasons: First the divisor should
    be 254 since the value 255 is specifically excluded in
    BlueBeats.cpp.  Second, since we multiply by PI we only have a range
    of angles from [0, 180].  This is ok for one of the angles, but does
    not allow the expression of all possible directions.  Is there a
    symmetry relation here that I'm missing?

    Answer:  This is the way it is done at Matthias's old lab.  In 
    the future we can do whatever we want.


2.  settings for dx, dy, dz.  Shouldn't this live with the 
    anatomy data?
 
    Answer: They actually do.  However for ease of rescaling the
    parameters were moved to the input deck.  We can put the values
    in the pio header and supply an override in object.data


3.  The globalTissueBlock is defined for each task by calling
    getORBdataScaled (BlueBeats.cpp:580).  How are the min and max
    values set? Do they include room for ghost cells?  We then go on to
    define quantities such as xMaxLocal that include extra room for
    param.boxoverlap.  This is the size that is used for creating the
    block arrays such as tissue, Vm etc.

    Answer:  The ORB calls return a box that bounds the local cells.
    The given overlap (param.boxoverlap) establishes the halo size.


4.  Can I assume that there is always a layer of cells that are not
    tissue cells around every anatomic data set?

    Answer:  Matthias typically sets things up this way.  However
    the code should probably be smart enough to deal with it either
    way.
