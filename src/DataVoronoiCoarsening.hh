//Includes hacks from JPC to get Coarsened Activation Times out (changes marked with //AT-HACK), would eventually like to make it less hacky and interface with object.data (one bad thing I am doing is disabling the capability that was in previous version of DataVoronoiCoarsening code that allows you to print out data from multiple time points when evalrate<printrate, would be better if this was an object.data option.  I'm disabling this b/c to find Activation Times you'd want to evaluate often but print less frequently, which triggers printing out data from multiple time points in coarsened_anatomy#* files, which crashes the post-processing anatomy2ensight visualization tool as well as ECG code)
